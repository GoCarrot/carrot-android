= Android 12

NOTE: All version of the Teak SDK after 4.0.2 support targeting API Level 31 (Android 12).

== Notification Layouts

Android 12 introduces a new required notification layout, which changes how notifications are displayed.

With Teak SDK 4.0.2 (and later), these changes will happen automatically if your app is targeting API Level 31+ (Android 12) _and_ the device is running Android 12 or newer.

Examples of both text, and image notifications are below, including a sizing grid image for your reference.

=== Collapsed Notifications

Collapsed notifications now have a banner which contains the app icon, app title, and time the notification was received.

Prior to Android 12, the same notifications would look like this:
