= Android 12

NOTE: Teak takes care of all of this for you, this document just exists to make you aware of the changes and why they've happened.

Android 12 makes some changes to push notification layouts that impact Teak.

Collapsed notifications will always have the app icon next to the notification, and expanded notifications will always have a header that contains the app icon and app title, as well as the time the notification was received.

== Notification Layouts

Collapsed notifications will now always have the app icon next to the notification content.

Expanded notifications now always have a header above the notification content.

.Expanded Notification

These images are from the Android 12 documentation.

== What You Need to Do

Teak already handles these changes for you, provided you are using Teak SDK 4.0.2 or later, depending on the circumstances.

Teak will use the new notification style iff:

- Your app is targeting API 12+, and your app is running on an API 12+ device
- The Teak Server tells the Teak SDK to display the notification using the new style
