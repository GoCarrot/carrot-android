breaking:
  - If you are compiling with a target SDK of Android 26 or greater, Teak will now check requirements and throw an exception if the Android v4 support lib doesnâ€™t support Android 26 features (required features for push functionality)
bug:
  - Support explicit intents for Android 26+
  - Support notification categories for Android 26+
  - ADM listener fixed
  - Deadlock due to very slow network conditions fixed
