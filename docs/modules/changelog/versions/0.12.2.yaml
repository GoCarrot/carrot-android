new:
  - Push notification remote syntax is now versioned (non-breaking), new features:
  - Large/small image background
  - Support setting credentials in ``<meta-data>`` for Adobe Air.
bug:
  - Fix state machine bug where a RemoteConfiguration coming back when device was in background would assign the Configured Session state.
  - No longer calls ``ACTION_CLOSE_SYSTEM_DIALOGS`` when dismissing notifications
  - No longer DDoS ourselves with remote logging
