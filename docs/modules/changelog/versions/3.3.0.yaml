breaking:
  - If using Teak to create a separate Firebase instance, you must add ``io_teak_firebase_project_id`` and 
new:
  - Support Firebase Project Id for Firebase 20.1.6+
bug:
  - Push state chain limited to a length of 50
  - Fix ``public static void identifyUser(final String userIdentifier)`` overloaded method
  - No longer process deep links which are not Teak links
  - Reduce thread allocations, and add further measurement around thread and executor allocations
